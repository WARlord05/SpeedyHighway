üõ°Ô∏è ANTIVIRUS FALSE POSITIVE SOLUTIONS
=====================================

If your antivirus software flags SpeedyHighway.exe as suspicious, this is a FALSE POSITIVE.

WHY THIS HAPPENS:
- PyInstaller bundles Python runtime, which some antivirus software incorrectly flags
- The executable is unsigned, which triggers heuristic detection
- This is a VERY common issue with Python executables

OUR ANTIVIRUS COMPATIBILITY MEASURES:
‚úÖ Enhanced metadata with proper company information
‚úÖ Disabled UPX compression (reduces false positives)
‚úÖ Standard executable structure without obfuscation
‚úÖ Comprehensive version information and file descriptions
‚úÖ Clear file origins and purpose documentation

SOLUTIONS:
1. WHITELIST THE FILE (RECOMMENDED)
   - Add SpeedyHighway.exe to your antivirus whitelist/exclusions
   - For Windows Defender: Virus & threat protection ‚Üí Exclusions ‚Üí Add file
   - For McAfee: Real-Time Scanning ‚Üí Excluded Files ‚Üí Add SpeedyHighway.exe
   - For Norton: Settings ‚Üí Antivirus ‚Üí Exclusions ‚Üí Configure ‚Üí Add SpeedyHighway.exe

2. VERIFY THE FILE IS SAFE
   - File name: SpeedyHighway.exe
   - Publisher: WARlord05 Games
   - Description: Speedy Highway Racing Game - Enhanced Edition
   - Version: 1.0.1.0
   - Source: Built from open source Python code with antivirus compatibility features

3. TEMPORARY DISABLE
   - Temporarily disable real-time protection
   - Run the game
   - Re-enable protection after confirming it works

4. SUBMIT AS FALSE POSITIVE
   - Report to your antivirus vendor that this is a false positive
   - Most vendors will whitelist it after verification

VERIFICATION STEPS:
1. Check file properties - should show version info and publisher
2. File size should be approximately 27-30 MB
3. Scan with multiple antivirus engines online (like VirusTotal)
4. Source code is available for review on GitHub
5. Executable is located in root folder (SpeedyHighway.exe)
